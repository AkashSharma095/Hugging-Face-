The number for 2024-25 would be in focus as it is widely expected that the government would open its purse strings in an election year.</p><p><strong>Disinvestment/Privatisation:</strong> In current fiscal year the budgeted disinvestment target is likely to be missed, like the past five years. It is expected the government would set a realistic target of sub-Rs 50,000 crore for next fiscal.</p><p><strong>Capital </strong><strong>Expenditure</strong>: The government’s planned capital expenditure for this fiscal year is budgeted at Rs 10 lakh crore, higher than Rs 7.3 lakh crore in the last fiscal. The government has been pushing infrastructure creation and also incentivising states to step up capex.</p><p><strong>Tax </strong><strong>Revenue</strong>: The Budget had pegged direct and indirect tax mop-up at Rs 18.23 lakh crore and Rs 15.29 lakh crore for current fiscal, taking the gross tax collection to Rs 33.61 lakh crore.

Following this, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present her sixth budget in the Lok Sabha.- PTIStocks of companies related to railways were trading in the positive territory on Thursday morning ahead of the presentation of the interim Budget.Shares of IRCON International rallied 3.26 per cent, Texmaco Rail & Engineering jumped 2.71 per cent, Indian Railway Finance Corporation climbed 2.58 per cent and Rail Vikas Nigam advanced 1.52 per cent on the BSE.The stock of Jupiter Wagons went up 1.46 per cent, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) (0.88 per cent) and Titagarh Rail Systems (0.71 per cent).- PTIHere are the key numbers to watch for in pre-election Budget 2024-25:\\xa0Fiscal Deficit: The budgeted fiscal deficit, which is the difference between the government expenditure and income, for the current fiscal ending March 2024 is 5.9 per cent, against 6.4 per cent in the last fiscal. The number for 2024-25 would be in focus as it is widely expected that the government would open its purse strings in an election year.Disinvestment/Privatisation: In current fiscal year the budgeted disinvestment target is likely to be missed, like the past five years. It is expected the government would set a realistic target of sub-Rs 50,000 crore for next fiscal.Capital Expenditure: The government’s planned capital expenditure for this fiscal year is budgeted at Rs 10 lakh crore, higher than Rs 7.3 lakh crore in the last fiscal. The government has been pushing infrastructure creation and also incentivising states to step up capex.Tax Revenue: The Budget had pegged direct and indirect tax mop-up at Rs 18.23 lakh crore and Rs 15.29 lakh crore for current fiscal, taking the gross tax collection to Rs 33.61 lakh crore.

In 2021, when Budget was presented amidst COVID-19 pandemic, Ms. Sitharaman presented the first paperless Budget.Until 1999, Budgets were presented at 3 p.m. on the last working day of February. Jaswant Singh changed the Colonial-era practice and presented it at 11 a.m. In 2017, the Modi government decided to present the Budget on February 1 to make it easy for the annual budget exercise before the new financial year. It was in the same year the Railway Budget became the part of the Union Budget.\\xa0Since 1955-56, the practice of tabling Budget documents in both Hindi and English began.-PTIThough fresh schemes are not announced during Interim Budget, some Finance Ministers in the past have used the occasion to announce doles.For instance, the then Finance Minister Piyush Goyal in his interim Budget in 2019 had announced Rs 75,000 crore outlay for PM KISAN Samman Nidhi scheme wherein farmers are paid Rs 6,000 cash a year. He also raised standard deduction to Rs 50,000, and came up with tax rebate to ensure that individuals with income of up to Rs 7 lakh per annum are not taxed.In the pre-election Budget of 2014, the then Finance Minister P. Chidambaram in the Congress-led UPA government slashed excise duty on cars, SUVs, two wheelers, capital goods and consumer durables to boost manufacturing.Pranab Mukherjee too in his interim Budget in 2009 hiked the outlay for rural sector schemes to shield economy from the aftermath of global financial crisis triggered by collapse of US-based investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008.Jaswant Singh of the BJP-led NDA government in the 2004 pre-election interim Budget announced sops for central government employees.- PTIUnion Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has reached the Parliament, ahead of the presentation of the interim budget today.\\xa0Before the session begins, the Union Cabinet will meet to approve the interim budget document.\\xa0In the last five years, the BSE Sensex has given positive returns to investors four times on the Budget day and the benchmark rallied the most by 5% on the closing trade in 2021.Barring February 1, 2020, when the 30-share BSE benchmark ended 987.96 points or 2.42% lower, the bellwether index ended in the positive territory on the Budget day in the year 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2019.Read more here...Benchmark equity indices began the trade on an optimistic note on Thursday but later faced heavy volatile trends ahead of presentation of interim Budget.The 30-share BSE Sensex climbed 248.4 points to 72,000.51 in early trade after beginning the day on a positive note.

The Lok Sabha is empowered to authorise withdrawal of required funds from the Consolidated Fund of India for such expenditure.A simple vote on account includes presenting the Centre’s fund requirements for salaries, ongoing projects and other expenditure for the transitional period, and is then passed via the Lok Sabha sans debate. It cannot make any changes to tax rates. It is also valid only for two months and can be extended up to four months.\\xa0Read the whole explainer here.The Budget would, however, provide an occasion to assess the fiscal health of the economy against the backdrop of robust economic growth. It would provide an occasion for the government to give a clear roadmap for achieving the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBMA) targets.The budgeted fiscal deficit of 5.9% of the gross domestic product (GDP) for the current fiscal is likely to be achieved, but it is nearly twice the FRBM fiscal deficit to the GDP target of 3 per cent for the central government. Correspondingly, the debt-GDP ratio at 54 per cent is also well above the target of 40%.\\xa0PTIFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will on Thursday present the Modi 2.0 government’s last Budget before the general elections, which is likely to contain a mix of measures for the economy and electorally significant segments like farmers and women.Peppered with political innuendos, her sixth straight Budget may present a political document with a snapshot of the Modi government’s triumphs over the last 10 years and pointers to how it wants to take the country forward.With pressure for populist measures off after recent emphatic wins in three states, she is expected to stick to being fiscally prudent while sprinkling sops on sectors like agriculture and engines of the economy that would create jobs and boost consumption.\\xa0PTIAs Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman gears up to present the sixth Budget of her tenure, take a look at our quick guide on where and how to catch the live coverage of the Budget for the financial year 2024-2025.The banking sector in India witnessed a return to relatively good health over the past few years.
